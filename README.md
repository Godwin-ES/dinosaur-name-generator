# Dinosaur Name Generator

## Overview

The Dinosaur Name Generator project leverages Keras RNNs to generate realistic dinosaur names. Inspired by the Dinosaur Island-Character-Level Language Modeling assignment from the "Sequence Models" course on Coursera, this project demonstrates how to train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for text generation using a dataset of dinosaur names.

The project includes:
- Data preparation and preprocessing.
- RNN model architecture and training.
- Name generation functions with and without temperature scaling.
